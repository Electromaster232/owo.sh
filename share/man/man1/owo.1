.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Upload file:
.B owo
\-u test.bin
.PP
.TP
Shorten link:
.B owo
\-l 'https://duckduckgo.com'
.TP
Shuffle a list of domains and pass one to owo (assumes a list of domains in domains.txt, separated by newline):
.B shuf
\-n 1 < domains.txt |
.B xargs
\-I {}
.B owo
\-\-domain {} --screenshot
.TP
The above is also achievable using the config file, as all it is is a sourced script:
.B echo
"DOMAIN=$(shuf \-n 1 /absolute/path/to/domains.txt | xargs)" >> domains.txt
.TP
If you have a special clipboard manager installed, you can script copying like so:
.B owo
\-\-screenshot \-\-no\-clipboard |
.B your-super-cool-clip
\-
.TP
Toggle verbosity (it contains your key so be careful with the output!):
.B owo
\-v
.PP
.SH EXIT STATUS
owo returns a zero exit status if it succeeds in all given tasks.
Non zero is returned in case of failure, as script uses set -e.
